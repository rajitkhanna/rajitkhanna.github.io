<h1>Welcome to the Greatest Show on Earth!</h1>

<p>My name is Rajit Khanna. I'm a hacker, writer, reader, and <a href="https://rajitkhanna.com">blogger</a>. I study computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology and plan to graduate in April 2021. I built this website to encourage myself to keep making.</p>

<p>I'm interested in creating intelligent agents that augment our understanding of the world and of ourselves.</p>
